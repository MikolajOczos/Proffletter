User Story 1 :
A student of a certain field needs to change his field of study to another one because of personal reasons. He always struggled with writing formal documetns. He tries to make it sound formal but he still feels like it sounds like an sms to a colleague instead of a letter to uni represenative. Then he stumbles upon ProText, gives it a try and feels relieved. He sends the text and feels confident that he will be taken seriously. He might have learned some grammar rules as well with the process. Perhaps he will reccomend to his friends next day at University :-)
